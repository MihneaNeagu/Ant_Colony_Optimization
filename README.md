Project Title: Ant Colony Optimization for Traveling Salesman Problem Solver

Description:
This project aims to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using various optimization algorithms, including Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.

Problem Statement:
The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. Given a set of cities and the distances between them, the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.

Algorithms:

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): A metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It iteratively constructs solutions using artificial ants and updates pheromone trails to favor the exploration of promising regions of the search space.

Code Structure:

ant_colony_system.py: Contains implementations of the ACO for solving the TSP.
ant.py: Defines the Ant class representing a ant type object with its parameters.
main.py: Entry point of the program where the algorithms are executed and results are printed.
tsp.txt: Input file containing the coordinates of cities.
Documentation:
The documentation folder includes detailed explanations of the algorithm, its implementations, and experiments conducted to evaluate its performance. It consists of code snippets, algorithm descriptions, experimental results, and interpretations. It also includes important data comparisons with other AI algorithms used for also solving the TSP problem such as Simmulated Annealing and Evolutive algorithms.

Experiments:
Experiments were conducted using different problem instances and algorithm parameters to analyze the performance of each algorithm.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (numpy, matplotlib, time, random, math).
Run main.py to execute the algorithms and view the results.
